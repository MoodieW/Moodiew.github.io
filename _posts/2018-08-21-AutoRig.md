This was By far the largest and most difficult project I have taken on. The task was to build 
an auto rigger that was modeled after the lead riggers' workflow to help him produce the rigs for
the current Project X film. As being pretty fresh to tool development this was daunting, but I opened
up his rigs, reverse engineered it and got to work using an OOP (object oriented programming) approach.

We had one rigger and multiple rigs that needed to be done. The goal was simple, design auto rig 
modeled after the current rig he was working on. It needed to do the following:

* Have quick rebuild times.
* Use the riggers control preference scheme.
* be expandable to characters of all shapes and sizes.
* Be in usable condition before the fall semester.
* Start learning PyQt "More of a personal goal"

The first thing to tackle was quick rebuild times. The method I chose was simple but effective.
Build a null node that stored all of the joint information at time of creation. If the rig was dismantled
to be rebuilt it would read in the previous joint information and use it as the new default location for 
our place holder joints. This saves the user from having to replace joints when they tear the rig down.
Once the user defines new positions the null node is updated for use in the next rebuild. The null was locked 
and was intended to live in each rig reference scene.

The lead Rigger, Alex Wilson, has very specific taste in his controls setups and utilizes nurbs  with 
a very specific style of shader. Being new to tool development I felt this project was a perfect opportunity to 
start exploring an OOP approach and this was the first part to receive that treatment.

The expandability to several character of different shapes and size was done with user input. While the autorig 
does 80% of the heavy lifting the rigger still needs to do some direct manipulation to get things setup
as demonstrated above the. All of the control still have history to them, that history is left for small
tweaks and after can be deleted with a function in the autorig system.

While PyQt was a not as successful as I wanted it be, I still learned:

* Object oriented. 
* an introduction to PyQt.
* how to structure very large amounts of code.

This was a big project for me and I learned a lot. If I could go back and redo stuff I would. I could utilize 
Object orientation a lot more with design when it comes to the body I.E arm class, leg class, spine, Etc...
I'm closing the book on this project for now because its functional enough to get teh job done and I need
to help get tools setup for the animators soon.

last but not least none of this would have been possible with out Rob Galanakis' book on practical 
programming in Maya.
