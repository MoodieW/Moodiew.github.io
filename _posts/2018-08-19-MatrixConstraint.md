excerpt: "Through my internet searches I came across a method 
that is more cost effective than maya's built in constraint system. This method uses some of maya's 
matrix utility nodes to create a constraint system. I decided to make a tool that automates this method
and mirrors maya's built in constraint tool for easy use."

Through my internet searches I came across a <a href="https://bindpose.com/maya-matrix-nodes-blending-matrices/" class="btn btn--primary">method</a>  
that is more cost effective than maya's built in constraint system. This method uses some of maya's 
matrix utility nodes to create a constraint system. I decided to make a tool that automates this method
and mirrors maya's built in constraint tool for easy use.

The goal for this project was fairly simple.

* Create a tool that was similar enough to maya's built in constraint tool that was familiar.
* Learn how to use the PyQt library to build the UI.
* Make sure the functionality can me separated from the UI.
* Lastly get it done in a weekend for my rigging buddy to test.

Overall I'm pretty happy that I was able get a better handle on Qt and that programmatically I
can see major improvements in my work. From learning python about seven months ago to building three 
tools that my colleague would use in their work flow is awesome!
