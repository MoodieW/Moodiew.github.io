Moodie is the name and I am an oil painter, sculptor, Dragon Ball FighterZ playing,
grilled cheese loving guy who has recently given into the dark side known only as programming.

I'm one of those kids who enjoyed watching the special features section of the movie
more than I enjoyed the movie. So slowly, but surely I worked my way into the film 
industry and worked on a few productions. Then one tragic day, I took an arrow to the 
knee. I did not let it stop me and my valiant quest to be apart of the entertainment 
industry in some way. Now I'm a technical artist, currently focusing on tools development
and trying to turn myself into a Technical Director because I love the way tech enables art.

In my spare time, you can catch me stuffing my face with a different assortment of food 
having a good time meeting new people, and crying during epic moments in 
My Hero Academia.

Also if you know the phrase don-don-donuts! We are pretty much best friends now.
